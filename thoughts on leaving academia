Thoughts, about a year after leaving academia.

I hope this doesn't come across as a bitter "why I left academia" tirade. I made a choice to not go on the academic market, I left on my terms, and I'm still on good terms with my committee members. I don't intend for any of this to be bridge-burning, recriminations, or anything to that effect. I simply hope to set out, for any political scientist considering leaving academia for industry.

One thing that permeates this essay is *luck.* Being in the right place, at the right time, with the right set of skills is worth as much as any preparation, however, if you're not prepared luck happens, you won't be able to take advantage of it.  

# What have I been up to?

I received my PhD in political science from The Ohio State University in June 2019. In July 2019, I moved to NYC to work as a Data Scientist at a non-profit focusing on Environmental and Social Governence (ESG) issues. In April 2020, I left that non-profit, and started as a data scientist at a large investment bank.

# Why leave academia?

Multiple reasons:

1) Family. My wife and I both have PhDs, and we both wanted to pursue our careers. My last two years of grad school, we drove back and forth between Saginaw, MI and Columbus, OH (almost) every weekend, a 4.5 hour drive *each way*. Had I decided to go the academic route, there was no guarantee we would have even ended up in the same state, let along the same city. Quite frankly, I didn't love "the life of the mind" so much that I'd prioritize a (potential) academic job over my marriage.

2) Professional interests. I liked the part of grad school that involved working with data and writing code. I was reasonably good at it. Having the first paper of my dissertation rejected from journals twice, I made a decision that I didn't want to spend the next 30ish years of my life arguing with reviewers like that. That's not to say academia is a bad career choice, you just have to know what you're getting into. I had a taste, and didn't like it.

3) Location. Before OSU, I did my undergrad at Grinnell College, located in Grinnell, Iowa (a small town) and then, worked there for a year after graduating. Small town life when you're a student is great, once you're not, it can be isolating, and ultimately, I didn't want to wind up in a small town. The probability of landing an academic job in a city isn't great (it's even smaller than the probability of landing an academic job in general), and mentioned above, I also wanted to live with my wife, which seemed unlikely in a small town, if we both wanted careers.

## Do I regret it?

No. This isn't the location for some overwrought prose about how I wish I could get back in. I've done interesting work in both jobs I've had. I work with smart people, and I get to do interesting work. Furthermore, I keep learning -- leaving academia doesn't mean you stop learning. 

Also, I now live with my wife in NYC, and that's pretty awesome.

# Advice?

What advice would I have for a political scientist interested in leaving academia for industry? Think of a job search as optimizing four variables:
1) What you do: coding, working with data, writing reports, research, public speaking,  etc.
1a) What kind of job do you want? Research, public facing, teaching? Remote? Office-based?
2) Where you'll live: What region of the country do you want to live in? Do you want to live in a city, or a rural area?
3) Salary: how much do you want to make, and what kind of work schedule do you want?
4) Personal considerations: The two body problem, visa concerns, etc?

In academia, you optimize 1), with the potential for variation on 1a) (teaching vs. research). If you leave academia, you can choose to optimize on all four!


When it comes to advice about the job search, I worry that any advice I can give will be idiosyncratic, and so, take everything I say with a grain of salt.

When it comes to applying, figure out what you want to optimize, and then, figure out what kind of jobs match those criteria. You'll then send out a lot of applications, especially if you're applying for data scientist roles. My first time applying, while in grad school, I sent out about 70 applications, got two phone screens, one flyout interview that didn't turn into an offer, and one offer. 

What to emphasize? R coding, projects you've worked on, teaching (especially methods). 

More than anything though, it's important to use your network. Especially as a political scientist, your toughest challenge will be getting through keyword filters for degree that many employers use. If you know someone, and can get them to refer you, that will at least get you a phone screen. Then you have to sell yourself.

If you want to reach out, I'm happy to answer questions, and provide any advice I can.
